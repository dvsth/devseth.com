<h3 id="saturday-june-5">Saturday, June 5</h3><p>I am writing this at the end of the first week of the CS+ program. So far, I have had a great initial experience with the Vaccine Misinformation team as well as the broader CS+ group as a whole. Here are some scattered thoughts:</p><ul>
<li>This research experience seems to be more structured and well-defined than my past experiences, which were very open-ended and exploratory. I think getting exposed to a different research environment this summer will help me understand where I fit better.</li>
<li>Given that all my past research has been CS-adjacent but never really <em>in</em> CS, I think this project will allow me to use in-depth a lot of the CS knowledge/skills that I&#39;ve learned in the last few years.</li>
<li>Ever since I did the startup, I have realized that I enjoy working on real-world, immediate-impact problems a lot more than theory-based ones, so I am optimistic that I won&#39;t get bored or lose motivation a few weeks into the summer.</li>
</ul><p>Here are some things I did in the past week:</p><ul>
<li>Learned how to use the Research Computing Cluster. This was a very exciting process and it was thrilling to be able to have access to that much computing power. I&#39;m interesting to do some digging later and find out more about the systems-level work needed to make a large cluster function--how similar is it to a datacenter? How are the system design priorities different from that of a commerical cloud computing service?</li>
<li>Met new people, made new friends. CS+ seems to have a lot of social programming on the calendar, so hopefully I will be able to get to know some of them more closely.</li>
<li>Familiarized myself with the project. Vaccine misinformation is such a transdisciplinary concern, and I am interested in learning how we can combine a technological approach with other approaches to make a difference. I think that it&#39;s very common for tech people to look at a real-life problem with the mindset that adding more tech will solve it, often ignoring the rich complexity of the problem and its many social and psychological dimensions. I&#39;m glad that this project is cognizant of that tendency and am excited to work with people from the health field and other areas of expertise.</li>

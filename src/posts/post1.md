### Saturday, June 5
I am writing this at the end of the first week of the CS+ program. So far, I have had a great initial experience with the Vaccine Misinformation team as well as the broader CS+ group as a whole. Here are some scattered thoughts:

- This research experience seems to be more structured and well-defined than my past experiences, which were very open-ended and exploratory. I think getting exposed to a different research environment this summer will help me understand where I fit better.
- Given that all my past research has been CS-adjacent but never really *in* CS, I think this project will allow me to use in-depth a lot of the CS knowledge/skills that I've learned in the last few years.
- Ever since I did the startup, I have realized that I enjoy working on real-world, immediate-impact problems a lot more than theory-based ones, so I am optimistic that I won't get bored or lose motivation a few weeks into the summer.

Here are some things I did in the past week:

- Learned how to use the Research Computing Cluster. This was a very exciting process and it was thrilling to be able to have access to that much computing power. I'm interesting to do some digging later and find out more about the systems-level work needed to make a large cluster function--how similar is it to a datacenter? How are the system design priorities different from that of a commerical cloud computing service?
- Met new people, made new friends. CS+ seems to have a lot of social programming on the calendar, so hopefully I will be able to get to know some of them more closely.
- Familiarized myself with the project. Vaccine misinformation is such a transdisciplinary concern, and I am interested in learning how we can combine a technological approach with other approaches to make a difference. I think that it's very common for tech people to look at a real-life problem with the mindset that adding more tech will solve it, often ignoring the rich complexity of the problem and its many social and psychological dimensions. I'm glad that this project is cognizant of that tendency and am excited to work with people from the health field and other areas of expertise.

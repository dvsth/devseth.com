Owing to a paucity of work opportunities during the pandemic, I decided to teach myself HTML, CSS, Javascript and the ReactJS and ThreeJS frameworks. This website is an evolving indicator of my progress at learning these tools.

As a newcomer to front-end development, and as a verifiably lazy person, it was great to be able to learn from amazing work done by more experienced developers. Much credit to [James Warner](www.jmswrnr.com) for sharing how he made his interactive homepage, which heavily inspired my own.

My unique additions to James' work were:
1. Writing the 3D graphics code ðŸ’» from scratch as a ReactJS component
2. Creating new assets (including a pixel-perfect 8x8 Bitmap font which only has letters of my own name ðŸ˜‹)
2. Adding support for touchscreen devices ðŸ“² (e.g. adjusting aspect ratios, making the header interactive on mobile)
3. Improving performance ðŸ“ˆ through WeBGL hacks

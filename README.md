Owing to a paucity of work opportunities during the pandemic, I decided to teach myself **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript**, and the **ReactJS** and **Three.js** frameworks. This website is an evolving indicator of my progress at learning these tools.

As a newcomer to front-end development, and as a verifiably lazy person, it was great to be able to get a running start by exploring the amazing work done by more experienced developers. Much credit to [James Warner](https://jmswrnr.com/) for sharing how he made his interactive homepage, which heavily inspired my own.

My unique additions to James' work were:
1. Writing the 3D graphics code ðŸ’» from scratch as a ReactJS component
2. Creating new assets (including a pixel-perfect 8x8 Bitmap font which only has letters of my own name ðŸ˜‹)
2. Adding support for touchscreen devices ðŸ“² (e.g. adjusting aspect ratios, making the header interactive on mobile)
3. Improving performance ðŸ“ˆ through WeBGL hacks
